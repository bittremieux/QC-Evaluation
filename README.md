This code compares the performance of various sets of QC metrics, derived at different stages of the mass spectrometry process, in discriminating low-quality from high-quality experiments.

The software is available as open-source under the Apache 2.0 license.


Dependencies
------------

The code is fully written in Python 3. The required external modules are available in the file `requirements.txt` and can be installed directly via pip.
